Data Structures and ALgorithms

The main objective of the course is to teach the students how to select and design data structures and algorithms that are appropriate for problems 
that they might encounter. This course is also about showing the correctness of algorithms and studying their computational complexities.

When implementations are considered, the Java programming language is used. Topics covered in this course include:
 Design and analysis of algorithms
 Time complexity and asymptotic notation
 Dictionaries and hash tables
 Trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, multi-way search trees, (2,4)-trees, and B-trees
 Graphs, graph traversals, and graph algorithms
 Sorting algorithms.
